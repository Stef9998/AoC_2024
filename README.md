# Advent of Code 2024 solving

Planing on using Haskell and Python
Trying to solve the problems in a functional way for learning a bit of functional programming thinking.\
Go is just for learning go, not doing it functional.

## Learnings / Interesting Findings

### Python

Day 4 - Part 1

- Wanted to only use one pass through the input file
- Used a closure (for the first time) to keep track of the current state of the last line

Day 4 - Part 2

- really nice, clean functional solution

Day 22 - Part 2

- solved with iterators
