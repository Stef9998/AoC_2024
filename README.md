# Advent of Code 2024 solving
Planing on using Haskell and Python
Trying to solve the problems in a functional way for learning a bit of functional programming thinking.

## Learnings / Interesting Findings

### Python

Day 4 - Part 1
- Wanted to only use one pass through the input file
- Used a closure (for the first time) to keep track of the current state of the last line
  - went a bit overboard with the closures :D

Day 4 - Part 2
  - really nice, clean functional solution

Day 22 - Part 2
- solved with iterators
